# Social Network API

These all needed to be tied together respectively. Users have friends. Thoughts have reactions. Thoughts belong to users, which friends belong to, which reactions belong to.

## Installation

To test or use this api, clone the codebase.Run npm i to install all packages. Run the root index.js with the command: node index.js. This will start the server. You can then test the endpoints with a tool/ application such as insomnia. First you will need to seed the database using insomnia and the endpoints.
